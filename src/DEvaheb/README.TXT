DEhaveb v2.0
------------

The DEvahebOpen.cmd file wraps the executable and opens notepad. You can use
this cmd file instead of the .exe to open your IBI files. You can edit the
.CMD file in notepad (right-click Edit in Windows explorer) and instead of
opening "notepad" you can point it to the location of BehavED.exe on your
system, to VSCode, or whichever editor of your choosing.
